# 2022_IEEE_TPWRS_Submission_Repository
Data repository for the manuscript "Coordination of Frequency Reserves in an Isolated Industrial Grid Equipped with Energy Storage and Dominated by Constant Power Loads" submitted to the IEEE Transations in Power Systems in October 2022.

The data is divided into folders:
  - Simplified rotating mass model
  - Detailed model
  - Power hardware in the loop (PHIL)
  
## Simplified rotating mass model
Simulations performed with Matlab R2018a Update 6.

The following files are stored in this folder: 
  - FCR_sharing.slx: simulink linearized rotating mass model with three primary power providers, two gas turbines and an energy storage system.
  - FCR_sharing_Script.m: runs linear analyzes of the the simulink model for 7 different gain sets for the FCR providers, stores the eigenvalues of each analyzis in a csv file.
  - mateigen_run_1.csv ... mateigen_run_7.csv: output files of the script FCR_sharing_Script.m.
  
## Detailed model
