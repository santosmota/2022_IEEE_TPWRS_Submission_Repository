The electrical model is supplied only for information and for documentation.

The real-time simulation model contains proprietary blocks that could not be made public. Those were deleted, therefore, the electrical model will not run. 

The links to the library blocks of pwrsys-matlab may also be broken as the library and the original electrical model had different paths before being copied into this public repository.
